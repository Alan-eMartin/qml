    :title: What are quantum computers, and how can we train them in Python?
    :author: Josh Izaac (Xanadu)

    Using a mixture of real Python examples and illustrated diagrams, we show how to not only evaluate, 
    but also differentiate small quantum programs directly on quantum hardware. By extracting the gradients, 
    we can integrate these quantum programs directly into larger differentiable programs in Python, and 
    train/optimize the full (hybrid quantum-classical!) program.

    :title: Using Multiple QPUs
    :author: Nathan Killoran (Xanadu)

    What would you do with 1000 QPUs? In the latest release of PennyLane,
    we've introduced a number of new features to make computations involving multiple QPUs more
    seamless and accessible. See a number of simple ideas and use-cases where many QPUs could
    provide a benefit over a single QPU, even for today's small and noisy devices.
