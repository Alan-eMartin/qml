r"""Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET)
=========================================
Materials simulation presents a crucial challenge in quantum chemistry, as understanding and predicting the properties of 
complex materials is essential for advancements in technology and science. While Density Functional Theory (DFT) is 
the current workhorse in this field due to its balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, it often falls short in 
accurately capturing the intricate electron correlation effects found in strongly correlated materials. As a result, 
researchers often turn to more sophisticated methods, such as full configuration interaction or coupled cluster theory, 
which provide better accuracy but come at a significantly higher computational cost. 

Embedding theories provide a balanced 
midpoint solution that enhances our ability to simulate materials accurately and efficiently. The core idea behind embedding 
is to treat the strongly correlated subsystem accurately using high-level quantum mechanical methods while approximating
the effects of the surrounding environment in a way that retains computational efficiency. 
Density matrix embedding theory(DMET) is one such efficient wave-function-based embedding approach to treat strongly 
correlated systems. Here, we present a demonstration of how to run DMET calculations through an existing library called 
libDMET, along with the intructions on how we can use the generated Hamiltonian with PennyLane to use it with quantum 
computing algorithms. We begin by providing a high-level introduction to DMET, followed by a tutorial on how to set up 
a DMET calculation.

# Theory
# ------
# DMET is a wavefunction based embedding approach, which uses density matrices for combining the low-level description 
# of the environment with a high-level description of the impurity. DMET relies on Schmidt decomposition,
# which allows us to analyze the degree of entanglement between the impurity and its environment. Suppose we have a system
# partitioned into impurity and the environment, the state, :math:`\ket{\Psi}` of such a system can be 
# represented as the tensor product of the Hilbert space of the two subsytems
# .. math::
#
#     \ket{\Psi} = \sum_{ij}\psi_{ij}\ket{i}_{imp}\ket{j}_{env}
# 
# Schmidt decomposition of the coefficient tensor, :math:`\psi_{ij}`, thus allows us to identify the states
# in the environment which have overlap with the impurity. This helps reduce the size of the Hilbert space of the 
# environment to be equal to the size of the impurity, and thus define a set of states referred to as bath. We are
# then able to project the full Hamiltonian to the space of impurity and bath states, known as embedding space.
# .. math::
#
#      \hat{H}^{imp} = \hat{P} \hat{H}^{sys}\hat{P}
#
# where P is the projection operator.
# We must note here that the Schmidt decomposition requires  apriori knowledge of the wavefunction. DMET, therefore, 
# operates through a systematic iterative approach, starting with a meanfield description of the wavefunction and 
# refining it through feedback from solution of impurity Hamiltonian.
#
# The DMET procedure starts by getting an approximate description of the system, which is used to partition the system
# into impurity and bath. We are then able to project the original Hamiltonian to this embedded space and  
# solve it using a highly accurate method. This high-level description of impurity is then used to 
# embed the updated correlation back into the full system, thus improving the initial approximation 
# self-consistently. Let's take a look at the implementation of these steps.

# Implementation
# --------------
# We now use what we have learned to set up a DMET calculation for $H_6$ system.
#
# Constructing the system
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# We begin by defining a periodic system using the PySCF interface to create a cell object
# representing a hydrogen chain with 6 atoms. The lattice vectors are specified to define the
# geometry of the unit cell, within this unit cell, we place two hydrogen atoms: one at the origin
# (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and the other at (0.0, 0.0, 0.75), corresponding to a bond length of
# 0.75 Ã…. We further specify a k-point mesh of [1, 1, 3], which represents the number of
# k-points sampled in each spatial direction for the periodic Brillouin zone. Finally, we
# construct a Lattice object from the libDMET library, associating it with the defined cell
# and k-mesh, which allows for the use of DMET in studying the properties of the hydrogen
# chain system.
