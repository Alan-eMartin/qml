##############################################################################
# In this tutorial, we'll show you how to use Pennylane to interface with IBM's quantum computing
# platform. IBM is one of the largest quantum hardware providers in the world. Their quantum
# computers are based on superconducting qubits and their quantum computing platform enables you
# to run your quantum circuits on many of those devices.
# In this tutorial, we will learn how to:
# - Discover what kind of devices IBM offers
# - Connect to IBM devices through Pennylane's device class
# - Use Qiskit Runtime to run hybrid algorithms
# - Compare different devices to improve our quantum algorithms

##############################################################################
# Using IBM devices
# -----------------
# IBM offers access to a variety of devices, both classical simulators and real quantum hardware.
# By default, these devices are not included in Pennylane, but after installing the
# pennylane-qiskit package, they can be used just like any other device offered in Pennylane!
# Currently, there are three devices available: Aer, BasicAer and IBMQ, which can be initialized
# as follows:
import pennylane as qml

qubits = 4
dev = qml.device("qiskit.aer", wires=qubits)
dev = qml.device("qiskit.basicaer", wires=qubits)
try:
    dev = qml.device("qiskit.ibmq", wires=qubits, ibmqx_token="XXX")
except:
    print("No valid token provided!")

##############################################################################
# The last device on this list will cause an error, because we are not providing a valid account
# token. The IBMQ device is used to access quantum hardware, so it also requires access to an IBMQ
# account, which can be specified using an identifying token. You can find your token by creating
# or logging into your `IBMQ account <https://quantum-computing.ibm.com>`__. Be careful not to
# publish code which reveals your token to other people! One way to avoid this is by saving your
# token in a `Pennylane configuration file <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/introduction/configuration.html>`__.
# To specify which machine or computational framework these devices actually connect to, we can
# use the backend argument.

dev = qml.device("qiskit.aer", wires=qubits, backend="aer_simulator_statevector")

##############################################################################
# For the IBMQ device, different quantum computers can be used by changing the backend to the name
# of the specific quantum computer, such as ibmq_london or imbq_16_melbourne. To see which
# backends exist, we can call the capabilities function:

dev.capabilities()["backend"]

##############################################################################
# Qiskit Runtime
# ---------------
# Qiskit Runtime is a quantum computing service provided by IBM intended to make hybrid algorithms
# more efficient to execute. Hybrid algorithms are algorithms, where a classical computer and
# quantum computer work together. Often, this involves the classical algorithm iteratively
# optimizing the quantum circuit, which the quantum computer repeatedly runs.
#
# One such example is the VQE algorithm, which can be used to calculate the ground state energy of
# molecules. It contains an optimization loop, which repeatedly requests the device to run a
# parameterized quantum circuit. Because the optimization algorithm changes the values of the
# parameters, the circuit requested is different each iteration. Also, the change is dependent on
# the results of the previous circuit, which means that there needs to be constant communication
# back and forth between the quantum computer and the classical computer in charge of the
# optimization.
#
# The solution that Qiskit Runtime provides is placing a classical computer in close physical
# proximity of the quantum computer. The user uploads a job to the classical computer, which runs
# the entire hybrid algorithm together with the quantum hardware, with no intermediate user input.
# This automates the iterative process, which otherwise requires time and resources for
# communication between the user and the hardware provider.
# Using Qiskit Runtime
# --------------------
# The pennylane-qiskit plugin includes some tools to help create a Qiskit Runtime job. Since using
# Qiskit Runtime only makes sense when using real quantum hardware, we must again specify our IMBQ
# account details to run these jobs.
#
# First, we set up our problem as usual, and then retrieve a program ID from IBM, which gives us a
# place to upload our job

from pennylane_qiskit import upload_vqe_runner, vqe_runner
from pennylane import qchem
from pennylane import numpy as np

symbols = ["H", "H"]
coordinates = np.array([0.0, 0.0, -0.6614, 0.0, 0.0, 0.6614])
basis_set = "sto-3g"
electrons = 2

H, qubits = qchem.molecular_hamiltonian(
    symbols,
    coordinates,
    basis=basis_set,
)

try:
    dev = qml.device("qiskit.ibmq.circuit_runner", wires=4, ibmqx_token="XXX")
    program_id = upload_vqe_runner(hub="ibm-q", group="open", project="main")
except:
    print("No valid token provided!")

# Next, we specify our quantum circuit. Although there are many circuits to choose from, it is
# important to know that before a circuit is executed on hardware, it undergoes a transpilation
# step, which converts your circuit into a different, but equivalent circuit. The purpose of this
# step is to ensure that only operations that are native to the quantum computer are used. With
# parameterized gates however, this may cause some unexpected behavior, such as the emergence of
# more parameters when the transpiler attempts to decompose a complicated gate such as
# AllSinglesDoubles. These types of issues will likely be fixed in the future, but when in doubt,
# it is preferable to use simpler gates where possible. We will use a simple four qubit circuit
# with one parameter, designed specifically for the H2 molecule:


def four_qubit_ansatz(theta):
    # initial state 0011:
    qml.PauliX(wires=0)
    qml.PauliX(wires=1)

    # change of basis
    qml.RX(np.pi / 2, wires=0)
    qml.Hadamard(wires=1)
    qml.Hadamard(wires=2)
    qml.Hadamard(wires=3)

    qml.CNOT(wires=[3, 2])
    qml.CNOT(wires=[2, 1])
    qml.CNOT(wires=[1, 0])

    qml.RZ(theta, wires=0)

    qml.CNOT(wires=[1, 0])
    qml.CNOT(wires=[2, 1])
    qml.CNOT(wires=[3, 2])

    # invert change of basis
    qml.RX(-np.pi / 2, wires=0)
    qml.Hadamard(wires=1)
    qml.Hadamard(wires=2)
    qml.Hadamard(wires=3)


##############################################################################
# Finally, we can run our example VQE algorithm, by using the vqe_runner function. It has many
# options, which you can specify, such as the number of shots, the maximum number of iterations
# and the initial values of the parameters.

try:
    job = vqe_runner(
        program_id=program_id,
        backend="ibmq_qasm_simulator",
        hamiltonian=H,
        ansatz=four_qubit_ansatz,
        x0=[0.0],
        shots=8000,
        optimizer="SPSA",
        optimizer_config={"maxiter": 30},
        kwargs={"hub": "ibm-q", "group": "open", "project": "main"},
    )

except:
    print("Error! Make sure you have a valid program ID!")

##############################################################################
# The results are saved in the job variable, in SciPy optimization format. You can also check the
# results produced by any IBM device by logging in to your IBMQ account.

##############################################################################
# Benchmarking
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~
# One of the reasons why we even want to have access to these various devices and backends is so
# that we can benchmark the capabilities of the algorithms that we develop. Some simulators are
# particularly good with certain types of circuits, whereas other simulators are more general and
# may provide resources for simulating noise which mimics the kind of errors that real quantum
# hardware produces. Switching between your devices helps you learn more about your algorithm and
# can potentially provide guidance on how to make it better. For example, we can compare the
# performance of the default pennylane simulator to the qiskit aer_simulator by running the same
# VQE algorithm on both. The difference between these two devices is that the aer_simulator uses a
# finite number of shots to estimate the energy in each iteration, rather than performing an exact
# calculation using the information hidden in the vector representation of the quantum state.

    print(prev_energy_1, prev_energy_2)
    energies_1.append(prev_energy_1)
    energies_2.append(prev_energy_2)


##############################################################################
# We can see the difference between the two devices clearly, when we plot the energies over each
# iteration:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(energies_1, color="r", label="default.qubit")
plt.plot(energies_2, color="b", label="qiskit.aer")
z = [-1.136189162521751] * max_iterations
plt.plot(z, "--", color="k", label="Exact answer")
plt.xlabel("VQE iterations")
plt.ylabel("Energy (Ha)")
plt.legend()
plt.show()

##############################################################################
# The device with the finite number of shots is unable to converge to the right answer, because it
# is limited by the precision of the result in each iteration. This is an effect that will
# certainly appear in real quantum devices too, and it can be instructive to study this effect
# independently from all the other limitations on real devices, such as decoherence, limited
# topology and readout errors.
