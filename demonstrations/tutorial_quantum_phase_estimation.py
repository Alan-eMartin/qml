r"""Tour of Quantum Phase Estimation
=============================================================

The Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm is one of the most fundamental algorithms in quantum
computing. It is also one of the first algorithms that we expect to be practical in the Intermediate
Scale Quantum (ISQ) era. The algorithm solves a relatively simple task: finding the eigenvalue of a
unitary operator. Solving this problem efficiently has pivotal applications in many areas of science
such as calculating molecular energies in chemistry, solving linear system of equations, and quantum
counting. This demo explains the QPE algorithm and gives an intuition to help us exploit its full potential.

The problem
-----------

Let's first get a better understanding of the problem we are trying to solve. We are given a unitary
:math:`U` operator and one of its eigenvectors :math:`|\psi \rangle`. For a unitary operator, we
know that:

.. math::
    U |\psi \rangle = e^{2 \pi i \theta} |\psi \rangle,

where :math:`\theta` is called the *phase* of the eigenvalue. Our task is to find the *phase* and
the QPE algorithm helps us to approximate the value of the phase on a quantum computer. That is why
the algorithm is called quantum phase estimation! But how a quantum computer can solve this problem
better than classical computers?

There are several cases where a quantum computer outperforms the best known classical algorithm for
solving a problem. The most famous example is the Shor's algorithm for factorizing a prime number.
What Peter Shor did was to transform this problem into a problem that we know how to solve more
efficiently on a quantum computer: calculating the period of a function.

The QPE algorithm can be understood based on the same idea: it translates the phase search problem
into the calculation of the period of a function. To understand how, let's first see how we can
calculate the period of a function classically.

Calculating the period
----------------------

An elegant way to compute the period of a function is to use the famous method of
`Fourier Transform <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform>`_. To do this for a function
:math:`g(x)`, we evaluate the function for :math:`N` different values of :math:`x` and generate the
vector:

.. math::
    \vec{v} = (g(x_0), g(x_1), \dots, g(x_{N-1})).

Applying the Fourier transform to this vector gives us a new vector that contains information about
the frequency, and hence the period, of the original function. This is a technique widely used in
signal processing.

Let's see an example. We chose the periodic function :math:`g(x) = e^{\frac{\pi i x}{5}}` with the
period :math:`T = 10`. The :math:`x_i` can be simply chosen as integers from :math:`0` to
:math:`31`. This is how the function and its fourier transform look like:

# Note that we have separated the real and imaginary parts to better visualize the function. The
# right graph shows the possible frequencies and their magnitude. We use the value with the largest
# magnitude to approximate the fundamental frequency, i.e., :math:`f_0 = 3`. The period :math:`T`
# can now be computed as:
#
# .. math::
#     T = \frac{N}{f_0}.
#
# In our particular example with :math:`N = 32` and :math:`f_0 = 3`, the period is
# :math:`T \approx 10.67` which is very close to the exact value :math:`10` ðŸŽ‰.
#
# The QPE algorithm
# -----------------
# The QPE algorithm does something similar to what we saw above: it helps us to find the period
# :math:`T = \frac{1}{\theta}` of the function :math:`g(x) = e^{2 \pi i \theta x}` where
# :math:`e^{2 \pi i \theta}` is the eigenvalue of our desired unitary operator. To implement the
# algorithms, we first need the vector:
#
# .. math::
#    \vec{v} = (g(x_0), g(x_1), \dots, g(x_{N-1})) =
#    (e^{2 \pi i \theta (0)}, e^{2 \pi i \theta (1)}, \dots, e^{2 \pi i \theta (N-1)}).
#
# We can represent this vector by a state vector on a quantum computer. The desired state vector
# can be constructed by applying a sequence of controlled unitary gates raised to decreasing powers
# of math:`2`. Let's look an example for :math:`N = 8`. For simplicity, we first construct the
# vector :math:`(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, e^{2\pi i \theta (6)}, 0, 0)`. The following image illustrates
# the circuit that creates this state.
#
# .. figure::
#   ../_static/demonstration_assets/quantum_phase_estimation/controlled_sequence2.jpeg
#   :align: center
#   :width: 80%
#   :target: javascript:void(0)
#
# This approach can be easily generalized to create our desired vector
# math:`(e^{2 \pi i \theta (0)}, e^{2 \pi i \theta (1)}, \dots, e^{2 \pi i \theta (N-1)})`. We just
# need to start from :math:`N^{(-1/2)} (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)` instead of :math:`|6 \rangle` in
# our example. This can be efficiently constructed by applying Hadamard gates to our qubits
# initialized at a :math:`|0 \rangle` state. After having the desired state, all we need to do is to
# apply the adjoint of the Fourier transform which encodes the phase into the state of our qubits.
# But how a number such as math:`\theta = 0.532` can be encoded into the states? This can be done by
# using a nice trick: representing math:`\theta` in its binary format. For example, in the case of
# our math:`3` qubit circuit, a measured state of
# math:`|0 \rangle \otimes |1 \rangle \otimes |1 \rangle` corresponds to math:`\overline{0.001}`
# where the bar denots binary representation. Let's convert this binary number to decimal.
# Hence the reason for the initial block!
# need to do is to









# state vector    of the vector is done in two stages. The central block, which we will call :class:`~.ControlledSequence`, is in
# # charge of evaluating the function itself.Let's look an example for
# :math:`N = 8`. A state vector of length math:`8` corresponds to the quantum state of math:`3`
# entangled qubits.
#
# Similar to the To implement the   :math:`\theta` in .  It gives us We can also perform the Fourier transform a quantum computer using  through the QFT operator.
# Quantum Phase Estimation will make use of this with the above reasoning to be able to find the :math:`\theta`
# we were looking for. Suppose we had the function :math:`g(x) = e^{2 \pi i \theta x}`. This is also a periodic function
# with :math:`T=\frac{1}{\theta}`. Therefore, if we were able to obtain the period, we will find the phase.
# To do that, the first step is to create the vector:
#
# .. math::
#    \vec{v} = (g(x_0), g(x_1), \dots, g(x_{N-1})) = (e^{2 \pi i \theta \cdot 0}, e^{2 \pi i \theta \cdot 1}, \dots, e^{2 \pi i \theta \cdot (N-1)}),
#
# In QPE we can find 3 fundamental blocks: an initial row of Hadamards, a sequence of control gates and the inverse of
# the QFT. The first two blocks will help us to construct the vector and finally we will apply the adjoint of the
# Fourier transform to recover :math:`\theta`.
#
# .. figure::
#   ../_static/demonstration_assets/quantum_phase_estimation/phase_estimation.png
#   :align: center
#   :width: 80%
#   :target: javascript:void(0)
#
# .. note::
#     By definition the classical Fourier Transform coincides with the inverse of the Quantum Fourier Transform,
#     that is why the adjoint is put.
#
# The construction of the vector is done in two stages. The central block, which we will call :class:`~.ControlledSequence`, is in
# charge of evaluating the function itself. It works as follows: if we send it the vector :math:`(0,0,\dots,1,\dots,0,0)`,
# with just one 1 in the j-th position, we will obtain the vector :math:`(0,0,\dots,e^{2\pi i \theta j},\dots,0,0)`.
# To understand this, let's take a look at the following image:
#
# .. figure::
#   ../_static/demonstration_assets/quantum_phase_estimation/controlled_sequence2.jpeg
#   :align: center
#   :width: 80%
#   :target: javascript:void(0)
#
# The input vector that has only one :math:`1` is easily encoded in binary. In the example we have taken :math:`j = 6`,
# which can be encoded as :math:`|110\rangle`. The powers of the :math:`U` operators use precisely the binary
# representation to encode the phase. As we can see, we are adding the corresponding value inside the vector.
#
# Seen in this way, if we want to construct :math:`v`, we simply need to send to the Controlled Sequence the vector :math:`(1,1,\dots, 1)`
# to store the value of the function in all points. Being working in a quantum computer the vector will be normalized
# by a factor of :math:`\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}` and this can be efficiently constructed by simply applying Hadamard gates.
# Hence the reason for the initial block!
#
# .. note::
#
#   In this algorithm there is a relationship between the output of the qubits and the binary representation of :math:`\theta`.
#   If we represent :math:`\theta` in binary as:
#
#   .. math::
#       \theta = \overline{0.\theta_0\theta_1\theta_2}...
#
#   so each of these :math:`\theta_i` can take the value :math:`0` or :math:`1`, then it holds that:
#
#   .. math::
#      \text{QPE}|0\rangle^{\otimes n} |\psi\rangle â‰ˆ |\theta_0\theta_1\theta_2 \dots \theta_{n-1} \rangle|\psi\rangle.
#
#   This means that the i-th qubit stores the i-th digit in binary.
#
# Time to code!
# -----------------
#
# Great, we already know the meaning of each QPE block so it's time to put it into practice.
# For this purpose, we can take as operator :math:`U = R_{\phi}(2 \pi / 5)` and as eigenvector :math:`|1\rangle``

# Similar to the classical reasoning, we are now looking at the values of the possible frequencies with their magnitude.
# The peak of the frequency is found at the value :math:`2` and knowing that :math:`N = 8` we would have
# that :math:`T = 4`. Therefore our approximation of :math:`\theta` will be :math:`1/4 = 0.25`, close to the real value
# of :math:`0.2`. I invite you to increase the number of estimation qubits to see how the approach improves.
#
#
# Cleaning the signal
# -------------------------
#
# One of the advantages of the relationship between classical signal processing and QPE is that we can reuse knowledge
# and that is something we are going to do to improve our output. As we can see, the plot above shows with a small probability
# some noisy frequencies.
# These tails are called *leaks* and cause us to obtain unwanted values.
# One of the most commonly used techniques in signal processing is the use of windows, which are a type of function
# that is applied to the initial vector before apply the Fourier Transform. An example is to use the cosine
# window  [#Gumaro]_. In QPE the window refers to the initial block, so we simply replace the Hadamard with the
# :class:`~.CosineWindow` operator.

# Goodbye *leaks*! As you can see a small modification in the algorithm has *filtered* the noisy that were generated.
# Furthermore, such an operator can be efficiently constructed on a quantum computer!
#
# Conclusion
# ----------
# In this demo we have seen what is Quantum Phase Estimation and how it relates with signal processing.
# The great advantage of this approach we have shown is that it creates a perfect bridge between the classical
# the quantum techniques. Therefore, future very important lines of research can be oriented to translate all the
# discoveries already made in classical into the quantum field.
# I invite you to experiment with other examples and demonstrate what you have learned!
