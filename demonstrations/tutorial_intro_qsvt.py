There are few quantum algorithms deserving to be placed in a hall of fame üèÜ: Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm, quantum phase estimation;
maybe even HHL and VQE. While it's still early in its career, there is a new algorithm with prospects of achieving such celebrity status:
the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) algorithm. If you're reading this, chances are you have at least heard of this technique and its broad
applicability.

This tutorial outlines the fundamental principles of QSVT and explains how to implement it in PennyLane. We focus on the basics;
while these techniques may appear intimidating when reading the literature, the fundamentals are relatively easy to grasp.

Transforming scalars encoded in matrices
-----------------------------------------
My personal perspective on QSVT is that at its core it is a result in linear algebra. It tells us how to
transform matrices encoded in larger unitary matrices. In the simplest case,
we encode a scalar :math:`a` inside a 2x2 unitary :math:`U(a)`. By encoding we mean that the unitary depends explicitly
on :math:`a` in its matrix form. This can be done in multiple ways, for example:

.. math:: U(a) = \begin{pmatrix} a & \sqrt{1-a^2}\\
    \sqrt{1-a^2} & -a
    \end{pmatrix}.

Note that we need :math:`a` to be between -1 and 1. We then ask the crucial question that will get everything started:
what happens if we repeatedly multiply this unitary by some other unitary? ü§î

Again there are multiple choices,
for example a single-parameter diagonal unitary

.. math:: S(\phi) = \begin{pmatrix} e^{i\phi} & 0\\
    0 & e^{-i\phi}
    \end{pmatrix}.

This is known as the *signal-processing* operator.
The answer to our question is encapsulated in a result known as *quantum signal processing* (QSP). If we alternate products of
:math:`U(a)` and :math:`S(\phi)`, keeping :math:`a` fixed but varying :math:`\phi` each time, the top-left corner
of the resulting matrix is a polynomial transformation of :math:`a`. Mathematically

.. math:: S(\phi_0)\prod_{k=1}^d W(a) S(\phi_k) = \begin{pmatrix}
    P(a) & *\\
    * & *
    \end{pmatrix}.

We use the asterisk :math:`*` to indicate that right now we are not interested in these entries of the matrix.


The specific polynomial :math:`P(a)` has degree at most :math:`d` (determined by the number of angles), with values
between -1 and -1. This happens because every time we multiply by :math:`U(a)`, the degree of the polynomial is increased by one.
Its particular form depends on the choice of angles.
The main quantum signal processing theorem states that there exist :math:`d+1` angles that can implement _any_ polynomial
of degree :math:`d`. This remains the case even using different conventions for the matrices, which are supported in PennyLane.
Finding the desired angles is feasible in practice, but identifying the best
methods is an active area of research. I invite you to explore our demo on quantum signal
processing if you are interested in more details. [link]

For now, let's look at a simple example of how quantum signal processing can be implemented using
the latest tools in PennyLane. We aim to perform a transformation by the Legendre polynomial
:math:`(5 x^3 - 3x)/2`, and we will be using pre-computed optimal angles.

As you will soon learn, QSP can be viewed as a special case of QSVT, so  will use the `qml.qsvt()`
function to implement a QSP circuit.

# Quantum signal procesing is a result regarding multiplication of 2x2 matrices, but it is the core result
# underlying the QSVT algorithm. If you've made it this far, you're in great shape for the rest to come.
#
# Transforming matrices encoded in matrices
# ------------------------------------------
#
# Time to ask another key question: what if instead of encoding a scalar, we encode an entire matrix :math:`A`? üß†
# This is trickier since we need to ensure that the larger matrix remains unitary. One way to achieve this
# is to generalize the construction for the scalar case. This works and it looks like this
#
# .. math:: U(A) = \begin{pmatrix} A & \sqrt{1-A A^\dagger}\\
#     \sqrt{1-A^\dagger A} & -A^\dagger
#     \end{pmatrix}.
#
# This approach works regardless of the form of :math:`A`; it doesn't even have to be a square matrix. We do
# need that :math:`A` is properly normalized such that its largest singular value is bounded by 1, otherwise
# :math:`U(A)` would not be unitary.
#
# Any such method of encoding a matrix inside a larger unitary is known as a *block encoding*. In our construction,
# the matrix :math:`A` is encoded in the top-left block, hence the name. PennyLane supports
# the `BlockEncode()` operation that follows the construction in the equation above. Let's take a look at how it works

import numpy as np

A = [[0.1, 0.2],
     [0.3, 0.4]]
U1 = qml.BlockEncode(A, wires=range(2))
print("U(A) = ", np.round(qml.matrix(U1), 2))

##############################################################################
# And for a rectangular matrix
B = [[0.5, -0.5, 0.5]]
U2 = qml.BlockEncode(B, wires=range(2))
print("U(B) = ", np.round(qml.matrix(U2), 2))

# So far we haven't really made an explicit reference to quantum computing. We "cheated"
# by using a qubit simulator to multiply 2x2 matrices, but otherwise everything remains just linear algebra.
# Told you so! üòà However, in general it is not always clear how to construct a quantum circuit that implements
# a block-encoding unitary, especially if we want to do so with minimal resources. We don't cover these
# methods in detail here, but a popular approach is to begin from a linear combination of unitaries for $A$,
# from which we define associated :math:`\text{PREP}` (prepare) and :math:`\text{SEL}` (select) operators.
# Then the unitary
#
# .. math::  U=\text{PREP}^\dagger\cdot\text{SEL}\cdot\text{PREP},
#
# is a block-encoding of :math:`A` up to a constant factor.
#
# Time for a third key question: Can we use the same strategy as in quantum signal processing to
# polynomially transform a block-encoded matrix? Because that would be awesome. üòé
#
# For this to be possible, we first need to generalize the operator
# :math:`S(\phi)`. It turns out that this can also be done following a standard construction where we choose a
# diagonal unitary, but this time apply the phase :math:`e^{i\phi}` to one subspace determined by the block,
# and the phase :math:`e^{-i \phi}` everywhere else. For the example matrix :math:`A` in
# the code example above, the corresponding operator is
#
# .. math::  \Pi(\phi)=\begin{pmatrix} e^{i\phi} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
#    0 & e^{i\phi} & 0 & 0 \\
#    0 & 0 & e^{-i\phi} & 0\\
#    0 & 0 & 0 & e^{-i\phi} \\
#    \end{pmatrix}.
#
# These operators as known as a *projector-controlled phase gates*. When :math:`A` is not square,
# we have to be careful and define two operators, one acting on the row subspace and another on the
# column subspace. Projector-controlled phase gates are implemented in PennyLane using the
# qml.PCPhase()` operation.

dim = 2
phi = np.pi/2
pi = qml.PCPhase(phi, dim, wires=range(2))
print("Pi = ", np.round(qml.matrix(pi), 2))
