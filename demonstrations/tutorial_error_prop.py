*Authors: Jay Soni, â€” Posted: 10 November 2023.*

Quantifying the effects of errors / approximations in our gates and how they relate to the error in our
final measurement outcomes is very useful for mordern quantum computing workflows (especially in the 
NISQ era). Typically, these types of computations are performed by hand due to the varity of error metrics
to track and the specific handling of such errors for each sub-routine. To the best of our knowledge, 
there is currently no generally agreed upon systematic approach to tracking and "propagating" errors 
through a quantum workflow. 

Introduction
------------
In this demo, we explore (with little modification to PennyLane) a simple workflow for tracking and 
propagation errors. We take a Hamiltonian simulation problem as an initial case study to work through the
process. Let's begin by creating an object to represent our error object.

We inherit from the abstract :class:`~.error_prop.OperatorError` class which requires implementing two 
abstract methods. The first is the :code:`__add__` method which is responsible for combining 
two erroneous operations in a quantum circuit.

# Problem:
# --------
# Suppose that we are interested in evolving an initial state under a target hamiltonian and 
# then measuring some quantity of interest from the result. There are many different approaches 
# to approximating the time evolution unitary, having a method to benchmark this would be useful 
# in determining which approach to use under which circumstances. 
#
# Below we define our initial state, target hamiltonian and final measurement:

wires = [0]
dev = qml.device("default.qubit")

# Hamiltonian to time evolve wrt: H = 123 * XY - 45 * ZZ + 0.6 * YX + IZ
H = qml.sum(
    qml.s_prod(123, qml.prod(qml.PauliX(0), qml.PauliY(1))),
    qml.s_prod(-45, qml.prod(qml.PauliZ(0), qml.PauliZ(1))),
    qml.s_prod(0.6, qml.prod(qml.PauliY(0), qml.PauliX(1))),
    qml.s_prod(1, qml.PauliZ(1))
)

def prep_initial_state(wires):
    """Prepare |+> in all qubits."""
    for w in wires:
        qml.Hadamard(w)


@qml.qnode(dev, interface=None)
def circuit(time_evo_op):
    
    prep_initial_state(wires)
    
    qml.apply(time_evo_op)
    
    return qml.expval(qml.prod(qml.PauliZ(0), qml.Hadamard(1)))  # measure < Z(0) @ Hadamard(1) >

###############################################################################
# Now we use the circuit above and execute with two different time evolution sub-routines, 
# one exact, the other approximate: 

# Exact time evolution:
time_evo_op1 = qml.exp(H, coeff=1j)

print(circuit(time_evo_op1))
print(qml.draw(circuit, expansion_strategy="device")(time_evo_op1), "\n\n")


# Approximate time evolution: 
time_evo_op2 = My_Approx_Trotter(H, time=1, order=1, n=1)

print(circuit(time_evo_op2))
print(qml.draw(circuit, expansion_strategy="device")(time_evo_op2))

###############################################################################
# We see that there is a difference in the computed expectation value. We can use the error 
# tracked to bound the error in expectation.
#
# Resource Analysis: 
# ------------------
# The error can be extracted from the circuit in the same way we track resources, using the 
# :func:`~.pennylane.specs` function. Simply query the :code:`"resources"` key of the specs 
# dictionary and extract the error attribute. This will be an instance of the error 
# class we defined above :code:`SpectralNorm_Error`.

circ_resources = qml.specs(circuit)(time_evo_op2)["resources"]  # extract resources from circuit specs
error = circ_resources.error[0]                   # Spectral Norm error propagated through the circuit.


print("Error in expval is: ", abs(circuit(time_evo_op1) - circuit(time_evo_op2)))
print("Which is less than: ", error.error)  # The expected value is correct within 2 * norm(H) * error

# Let's use everything we have built and apply it to explore the error scaling of Trotter product 
# formulas of higher order for increasing number of trotter-steps:

# We can see that the simple error bound is higher than the computed error for both 1st order and

#
# Conclusion
# -------------------------------
# In this demo, we showcased the :class:`~.pennylane.ResourcesOperation`, and the 
# :class:`~.pennylane.error_prop.OperatorError` classes in PennyLane. We explained how to construct 
# a custom resource operation and custom error type. We used this in a simple circuit to track and 
# propagate the error through the circuit to the final measurement. We hope that you can use this 
# tools in cutting edge research workflows to estimate error.
